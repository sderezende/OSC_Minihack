Pill Hunter

We used the ELEGOO Arduino kit to build a device that reminds people to take their pills by incorporating a countdown timer, an LCD display, colorful LED alerts, and a buzzer that plays a melody when itâ€™s time. The reminder can be silenced with a button, which resets the timer and updates the display for the next dose.
